    "text": "Couple days ago folks from Marimo published a YouTube video about marimo-quarto plugin. I had prior experience writing blogs with R Quarto, but I didnâ€™t have any experience on Python. I just decided to give it go.\nI first tried the replicate the steps in R Studio IDE and I hilariously failed! After my first fail, I follow the steps on the video with VS Code and I failed again. Blog was loading but those beautiful reactive elements from Marimo were not working. Later, I found the solution in marimo-quarto GitHub issues page.\nIt was an enjoyable learning experience overall. Iâ€™m planning to publish my marimo notebook projects in foreseeable future.\nI copied the code chunk below directly from marimo-quarto Github repository."
