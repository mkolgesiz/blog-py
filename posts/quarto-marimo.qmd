Couple days ago folks from Marimo published a YouTube video about [marimo-quarto plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scuGmtv81S0). I had prior experience writing blogs with R Quarto, but I didn't have any experience on Python. I just decided to give it go.

I first tried the replicate the steps in R Studio IDE and I hilariously failed! After my first fail, I follow the steps on the video with VS Code and I failed again. Blog was loading but those beautiful reactive elements from Marimo were not working. Later, I found the solution in [marimo-quarto GitHub](https://github.com/marimo-team/quarto-marimo) issues page.

It was an enjoyable learning experience overall. I'm planning to publish my marimo notebook projects in foreseeable future.

I copied the code chunk below directly from marimo-quarto Github repository.

## Just another Quarto project

```python {.marimo}
#| echo: true
import marimo as mo
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 10, 1, label="Look, a slider!")
slider
```

## More things

And we can respond!

```python {.marimo}
# No echo here means we do not show the code
mo.md("NaNðŸ˜„" * slider.value + " Batman!")
```
