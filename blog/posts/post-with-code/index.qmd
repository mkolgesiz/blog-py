This is a post with executable code.

# Just another Quarto project

```python {.marimo}
#| echo: true
import marimo as mo
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 10, 1, label="Look, a slider!")
slider
```

## More things

And we can respond!

```python {.marimo}
# No echo here means we do not show the code
mo.md("NaN" * slider.value + " Batman!")
```
